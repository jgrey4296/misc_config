(require 'ob-eval)
;; possibly require modes required for your language

;; optionally define a file extension for this language
(add-to-list 'org-babel-tangle-lang-exts '("$1" . "$2"))

;; optionally declare default header arguments for this language
(defvar org-babel-default-header-args:$1 '())

;; This function expands the body of a source code block by doing
;; things like prepending argument definitions to the body, it should
;; be called by the 'org-babel-execute:$1' function below.

;; This is the main function which is called to evaluate a code
;; block.
;;
;; This function will evaluate the body of the source code and
;; return the results as emacs-lisp depending on the value of the
;; :results header argument
;; - output means that the output to STDOUT will be captured and
;;   returned
;; - value means that the value of the last statement in the
;;   source code block will be returned
;;
;; The most common first step in this function is the expansion of the
;; PARAMS argument using 'org-babel-process-params'.
;;
;; Please feel free to not implement options which aren't appropriate
;; for your language (e.g. not all languages support interactive
;; "session" evaluation).  Also you are free to define any new header
;; arguments which you feel may be useful -- all header arguments
;; specified by the user will be available in the PARAMS variable.
