* Boundaries of the System Under Study
:Description:
What System are you studying and where does it start and stop?
What are you analyzing and what are you NOT, and why.
:END:
I am studying inhabited institutions, at the level of performance and minimal abstraction.
I am studying those performances as cycles, changing over time but patterned.
I am studying the computational authoring and generation of such dynamic performances of inhabited institutions,
at a scale of multiple, interacting instances of institutions to include the State in a performed system.

I am not studying NLP, or the generation of novel language.
I am not studying deep neural networks.
I am not studying a specific institution, or doing anthropological fieldwork.
I am not studying societies, macro-economics, or statistical perspectives of institutions.

* The Problem, Issue, Puzzle
:Description:
What problem are you seeking to examine/explain/explore and why?
Why is it a problem?
Is it an issue that needs to be addressed through social interventions?
Is it an issue that requires strategic action?
Why is the problem worth studying?
:END:

* Analytical and Scalar Architecture
:Description:
What scale are you working at?
Are you studying phenomena at the neighbourhood, community, local gov, individual, system scales?
Are you analyzing cross-scalar dynamics?
:END:

* Unit of Analysis
:Description:
What exactly are you studying?
Is it a city, country, region?
Community? Individuals within a community?
Is it a case or a series of cases?
Which actors/phenomena are you focusing on?
:END:

* Data Collection and Data Analysis Methods and Methodologies
:Description:
There is a very clear difference between data COLLECTION (and types of data)
and data ANALYSIS (and methods of analysis)
:END:

* Contribution (Theoretical or Empirical) to the Literature
:Description:
Should be able to state within a 90 second pitch.
:END:

* Position of the PhD Dissertation within contemporary and classical debates
:Description:
Demonstrate how you contribute (by extending X author's scholarship, by offering a new dataset,
by creating a different method to analyse a phenomena, exploring a new idea using innovative methods...)
:END:

* Methodological Tools
:Description:
Which methods are used in the dissertation, and which are not, but which could
have if they had the time, data etc.
:END:

* Limitations of the Research, potential future research
:Description:
How the thesis positions the student within the global theoretical debates,
and/or how it contributes empirically to our better understanding of phenomena
we would not have been able to analyse better were it not for the student's
dissertation.
