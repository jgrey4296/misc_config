*** Org Settings
**** "#+ARCHIVE %s_done"
      Sets the archive location of the agenda file.  The corresponding
      variable is ‘org-archive-location’.
**** ‘#+CATEGORY’
      Sets the category of the agenda file, which applies to the entire
      document.
**** ‘#+COLUMNS: %25ITEM ...’
      Set the default format for columns view.  This format applies when
      columns view is invoked in locations where no ‘COLUMNS’ property
      applies.
**** ‘#+CONSTANTS: name1=value1 ...’
      Set file-local values for constants that table formulas can use.
      This line sets the local variable
      ‘org-table-formula-constants-local’.  The global version of this
      variable is ‘org-table-formula-constants’.
**** ‘#+FILETAGS: :tag1:tag2:tag3:’
      Set tags that all entries in the file inherit from, including the
      top-level entries.
**** ‘#+LINK: linkword replace’
      Each line specifies one abbreviation for one link.  Use multiple
      ‘LINK’ keywords for more, see *note Link Abbreviations::.  The
      corresponding variable is ‘org-link-abbrev-alist’.
**** ‘#+PRIORITIES: highest lowest default’
      This line sets the limits and the default for the priorities.  All
      three must be either letters A–Z or numbers 0–9.  The highest
      priority must have a lower ASCII number than the lowest priority.
**** ‘#+PROPERTY: Property_Name Value’
      This line sets a default inheritance value for entries in the
      current buffer, most useful for specifying the allowed values of a
      property.
**** ‘#+SETUPFILE: file’
      The setup file or a URL pointing to such file is for additional
      in-buffer settings.  Org loads this file and parses it for any
      settings in it only when Org opens the main file.  If URL is
      specified, the contents are downloaded and stored in a temporary
      file cache.  ‘C-c C-c’ on the settings line parses and loads the
      file, and also resets the temporary file cache.  Org also parses
      and loads the document during normal exporting process.  Org parses
      the contents of this document as if it was included in the buffer.
      It can be another Org file.  To visit the file—not a URL—use ‘C-c
      '’ while point is on the line with the file name.
**** ‘#+STARTUP:’
      Startup options Org uses when first visiting a file.

      The first set of options deals with the initial visibility of the
      outline tree.  The corresponding variable for global default
      settings is ‘org-startup-folded’ with a default value of ‘t’, which
      is the same as ‘overview’.

      ‘overview’

      When visiting a file, inline images can be automatically displayed.

      with a default value ‘nil’ to avoid delays when visiting a file.

      Here are the options for hiding leading stars in outline headings,
      and for indenting outlines.  The corresponding variables are

      To turn on custom format overlays over timestamps (variables

      ‘customtime’
      Overlay custom time format.
