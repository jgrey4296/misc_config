Adjoint       -

Class         - A collection of sets S defined by a property P that all members share: ∀s ∈ S, ∀ x ∈ s: P(x)
Proper Class - a class that is not itself as set.
Small Class   - a clas that is a set.

hom-functor -

Natural Transform - Nat(F, F'), ability to transform a functor F to F', while respecting the internal structure of the categories involved.

Category - A categorry C is a class of objects ob(C), class of morphisms mor(C), a domain dom: mor(C) -> ob(C), a codomain cod: mor(C) -> ob(C), a composition of morphisms, that is associative and left+right unit laws.
Composition of morphisms - ∀ a,b,c ∈ ob(C) : hom(a,b) x hom(b,c) -> hom(a, c).
left unit law - id(x) : x -> x, such that ∀ f ∈ mor(X) : id(x) · f = f.
right unit law - id(x) : x -> x, such that ∀ g ∈ mor(X) : g · id(x) = g.

small category - where both mor(C) and ob(C) as small classes.

Yoneda's Lemma - allows embedding a small category into a category of functors.
:yonedas_lemma:
S : the category of Sets.
C : a category.
F : C - > S

if locally_small(C):
then:
∀ A ∈ ob(C): h(A) = hom(A,-),  A covariant hom-functor.
where:
h(A)(f) = hom(A, f)
or
h(A)(f)(g) = f · g

The Lemma States:
∀ A ∈ C, Nat(h(A), F) = hom(hom(A,-), F) = F(A).
