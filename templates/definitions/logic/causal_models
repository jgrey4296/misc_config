Directed Acyclic Graph.
Every Strict Partial Order is a DAG.
Every transitive closure of a DAG is a strict partial order.

:Rule_of_Product_Decomposition:
For a DAG g:
P(X₁, X₂, ... X_n) = ∏ P(x_i | parent(x_i))

eg: X -> Y -> Z
P(X, Y, Z) = P(X) P(Y|X) P(Z|Y)

:END:

:Chains:
eg: X -> Y -> Z

Z and Y are Dependent.
Y and X are Dependent.
Z and X are likely dependent.
Z and X are independent, *conditional on Y*.
:END:
:Forks:
eg: Y <- X -> Z

X and Y are Dependent.
X and Z are Dependent.
Z and Y are likely Dependent.
Y and Z are independent, *conditional on X*.
:END:
:Colliders:
eg: X -> Z <- Y

X and Z are Dependent.
Y and Z are Dependent.
X and Y are independent.
X and Y are dependent, *conditional on Z*.
:END:

:Conditional_Independence_in_Chains:
Two variables, X and Y, are conditionally independent given Z, if:
there is only one unidirectional path between X and Y
and Z is any set of variables that intercepts that path.
:END:
:Conditional_Independent_in_Forks:
If a variable X is a common cause of variables Y and Z,
and there is only one path between Y and Z,
then Y and Z are independent conditional on X.
:END:
:Conditional_Independence_in_Colliders:
If a variable Z is the collision node between two variables X and Y,
and there is only one path between X and Y,
then X and Y are unconditionally independent
but are dependent conditional on Z and any descendants of Z.

:END:

:D-Separation:
A path p is blocked by a set of nodes Z if and only if
1. p contains a chain of nodes A -> B -> C or a fork A <- B -> C
   such that the middle node B is in Z (i.e., B is conditioned on), or
2. p contains a collider A → B ← C such that the collision node B is not in Z,
   and no descendant of B is in Z.

If Z blocks every path between two nodes X and Y,
then X and Y are d-separated, conditional on Z,
and thus are independent conditional on Z.
