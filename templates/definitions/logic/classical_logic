Impredicativity      - Self-referential definition.
Syntactic Entailment - P ⊢ Q : Q is derivable from P in system S by the transformation rules of S, independent of truth assignments.
Semantic Entailment  - P ⊨ Q : Q is derivable from P in system S by the transformation rules of S if there *not* a model I where P ∈ I and Q ∉ I.
Sound                - (⊢) ⇒ (⊨).
Complete             - (⊨) ⇒ (⊢).

Satisfiability       - there exists a model which is true.
Validity             - every model is true.
Consistency          - an expression that does not lead to a contradiction.
Decidability         - a procedure exists for computing the answer of an expression in finite time.

necessary            - Q only when P.
sufficient           - P therefore Q.

conditional          - material implication.   (P → Q) ⩭ ¬P ∨ Q.
biconditional        - material equivalence. P ⇔ Q ⇒ P → Q and Q → P
