Admissable                   - (redundancy). The set of theorms does not change when a rule is added to the system.

Open World Assumption        - statements whether be true even if they are not known to be true.
Closed World Assumption      - only statements known to be true are true.

modus ponens                 - Affirming the antecedent. (P → Q), P ⊢ Q.
modus tollens                - Denying the Consequent.   (P → Q), ¬Q ⊢ ¬P.
contraposition               - (modus tollens) Inverting the antecedent and consequent. P → Q becomes ¬Q → ¬P
inversion                    - P → Q becomes  ¬P → ¬Q
conversion                   - P → Q becomes   Q →  P
complement                   - P → Q becomes ¬(P → Q)

Affirming the consequent     - *Fallacy* : (P → Q), Q ⊢ P.
Denying the antecedent       - *Fallacy* : (P → Q), ¬P ⊢ ¬Q.

import-export                - P → (Q → R) ⩭ (P ∧ Q) → R

law of excluded middle       - P ∨ ¬P
double negation elimination  - ¬¬P ⇒ P.

De Morgan's Laws 1           - not (A ∨ B) = (not A) ∧ (not B).
De Morgan's Laws 2           - not (A ∧ B) = (not A) ∨ (not B).
