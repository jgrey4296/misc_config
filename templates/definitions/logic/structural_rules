Weakening                           - Addition does not change the truth of the expression. (A ⊢ X) ⇒ (A, B ⊢ X), (A ⊢ X, Y)
Contraction                         - Idempotence of entailment. (A, A, A ⊢ X) ⩭ (A ⊢ X) and  (A ⊢ X, X, X) ⩭ (A ⊢ X).
Exchange                            - Permutation. (A, B ⊢ X) ⩭ (B, A ⊢ X) and (A ⊢ X, Y) ⩭ (A ⊢ Y, X)
Cut                                 - Generalisation of Modus Ponens. (Γ ⊢ A, Δ) and (Γ', A ⊢ Δ') ⩭ (Γ, Γ' ⊢ Δ, Δ')
