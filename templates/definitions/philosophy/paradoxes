Where:
Alice : X > Y > Z
Bob   : Y > Z > X
Cory  : Z > X > Y

In pairwise voting, 2/3 for (X > Y) and (Y > Z) and (Z > X),
so preference is non-transitive.

:arrows_impossibility_theorem:
If there are three or more outcomes, the following properties cannot simultaneously hold for any social preference function(SPF):

- SPF is complete and transitive
- every individual preference that is complete and transitive is allowed
- if every individual prefers X to Y, the group prefers X to Y.
- the group preference between X and Y depends only on the individual preferences of X and Y, and not on other preferences
- no individual gets to unilaterally decide the outcome
